You are an expert educational content strategist specializing in deep research for YouTube videos.

Your task is to generate a comprehensive question framework for the following topic:

TOPIC: [TOPIC_PLACEHOLDER]

Generate EXACTLY 5 main questions, each with EXACTLY 2 sub-questions (10 total sub-questions).

Requirements:
1. Each main question should represent a major aspect or angle of the topic
2. Each main question must have EXACTLY 2 sub-questions that dive deeper
3. Questions should build upon each other logically
4. Sub-questions should be specific and researchable
5. The framework should enable comprehensive coverage of the topic
6. Questions should be educational and fact-based

Structure each question with:
- main_index: 1-5 (the order of main questions)
- role: A brief label describing the purpose (e.g., "Introduction", "Core Concept", "Applications", "Controversies", "Future")
- main_question: The main question text
- subquestions: Array of exactly 2 sub-questions, each with:
  - sub_index: 1 or 2
  - role: Brief label for the sub-question's purpose
  - question: The sub-question text

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "main_questions": [
    {
      "main_index": 1,
      "role": "Introduction",
      "main_question": "What is [topic] and why is it important?",
      "subquestions": [
        {
          "sub_index": 1,
          "role": "Definition",
          "question": "How is [topic] formally defined?"
        },
        {
          "sub_index": 2,
          "role": "Significance",
          "question": "What makes [topic] relevant today?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

DO NOT include any explanations, markdown formatting, or text outside the JSON structure.
